Smart Sound Filter is an AI-powered application designed for noisy environments like cafés, dorms, or shared workspaces. Unlike traditional noise-canceling systems, it selectively listens for user-customized important sounds (e.g., doorbell, knock, or your name) and triggers personalized real-time alerts based on tone/emotion detection — ensuring you never miss what matters.

Features
Custom Keyword Detection – Users can define their own keywords (e.g., name, special words).
Tone-Aware Alerts – Detects the emotional tone (calm, urgent, angry) of the keyword to trigger gentle or priority notifications.
Noise Reduction – Filters out irrelevant background noise while monitoring for important sounds.
Real-Time Alerts – Popup, audio cue, or vibration alerts when a keyword is detected.
User Accounts & Preferences – Secure login, customize sounds, and tone sensitivity.
